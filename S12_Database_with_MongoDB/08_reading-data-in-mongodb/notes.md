# Read Operation in MongoDB

    -> db represent to the current database used.
    -> we can do db.<collectionName>.find()
        It will show all the available documents in it.
        It returns a cursor, it is like an array

    -> For finding specific documents we can pass an object in find()

```javascript
db.<collectionName>.find({ user: "23" })
```

- Just like find we also have findOne method, Which returns only the first match (as Object not cursor).

```javascript
db.<collectionName>.findOne({ user: "23" })
```

- If we want to find document in more depth, use configuration object:

```javascript
db.<collectionName>.findOne({ user: {$gt : 2} })
```

        $gt -> greaterThan
        $gte -> greaterThanEqualTo
        $lt -> LessThan
        $lte -> LessThanEqualTo
