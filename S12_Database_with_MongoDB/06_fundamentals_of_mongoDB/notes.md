## Fundamentals of MongoDB

    MongoDB Server by default creates these databases:
    (We should not manipulate them)
        -> admin
        -> config
        -> local

### Database:

        -> The main entity for our app is Database.
        -> It can have multiple collections
        -> Drop database means DELETE Database.
        -> It is only created when we have atleast one collection & one document.

## Collections:

        -> It is a part of Database.
        -> It can have multiple documents.
        -> It is not actually array, but like array.
        -> Drop collection means DELETE Collection.

## Documents:

        -> It is JSON Object, which stores the actual data.

## Understandig this through making storageApp DB:

        Main Entity(DataBase) -> StorageAppDB
        Collection -> directoriesCollection.json
        Document -> Each Directory Object

## Connections:

        -> It means a connection between the client and the server.
        -> There can be different (user) connections on a single server.

## Commands:

        -> use("<Database Name>") OR use <Database Name>
            If the database it not-existing. It create a non-existence database. And use it
        -> show collections
            It will show all the existing collections.
