# MongoDB Number Data Types

- MongoDB provides different number data types to store numeric values based on size and precision.

` Int32 (Standard Number)`

        -> Used for regular integers.
        -> Suitable for most everyday use cases.
        -> Range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

` Int64 – NumberLong()`

        -> Used for very large integers that exceed the Int32 range.
        -> Required when numbers go beyond JavaScript's safe integer limit.

` Decimal128 – NumberDecimal()`

        -> Used for high-precision decimal values.
        -> Ideal for financial or scientific data where rounding errors must be avoided.
