Key takeaway:

- you can query/fetch based on the data types of the BSON data
- example -

```javascript
db.users.find({ property: { $type: 'string' } }); // DATA TYPES ARE CASE SENSITIVE
//or based on their numeric code as well using.
db.users.find({ property: { $type: 2 } }); // here 2 points to "string" (refer to mongodb bson reference docs)
```
