    Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices (nodes) and how they are logically or virtually connected in a network.

    Types of Network Topologies

    Point-to-Point	Direct connection between two devices
    Bus	            All devices connected to a single central cable
    Ring	    Devices connected in a circular fashion, each connected to two others
    Star	    All devices connected to a central hub/switch
    Mesh	    Every device connected to every other device
    Tree	    Hierarchical structure of star networks
    Hybrid	    Combination of two or more topologies
