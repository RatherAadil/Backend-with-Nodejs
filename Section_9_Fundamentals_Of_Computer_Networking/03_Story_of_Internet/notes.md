## History of Internet

### 1960s – The Cold War & ARPANET

        The U.S. feared a nuclear attack could destroy communication lines.
        ARPANET was created in 1969 to connect 4 universities using packet switching.
        First message sent: "LOGIN", but only "LO" was received before crash.

### 1970s – TCP/IP is Born

        Different networks couldn’t communicate with each other.
        Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn proposed TCP/IP in 1974, allowing all types of networks to connect.

### 1983 – The Internet is Born

        ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.
        This allowed multiple networks to become one big network — the Internet.

### 1986 – NSFNET & Academic Growth

        NSFNET connected more universities and research labs.
        Internet started expanding globally.

### 1990s – Public & Commercial Use

        Internet opened to the public and businesses.
        Services like email and file sharing became common.

### 2000s–Now – Rapid Growth

        High-speed internet, Wi-Fi, and smartphones took over.
        Billions of devices are now connected globally.

### Summary

    The Internet started as a defense project, grew through research, and became the global communication backbone we all use today.
