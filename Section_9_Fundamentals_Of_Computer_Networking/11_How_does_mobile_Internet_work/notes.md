## How does mobile internet work ?

    1. Phone Sends Signal
        Your phone talks to the nearest tower using radio waves.

    📡 2. Tower Picks It Up
        The tower catches your phone’s signal (for a call or internet).

    🧠 3. Tower Sends It to the Main Network
        The tower sends your signal to the main mobile network system.
            If you're making a call, it finds the other person.
            If you're using internet, it connects to the website or app.

    🌍 4. Tower Gets Response Back
        The main system or internet sends the response/data back to the tower.

    📱 5. Tower Sends It to Your Phone
        The tower sends the response back to your phone using radio waves.

    🚗 6. If You Move...
        If you move away, the tower hands off your connection to a new nearby tower so you don’t lose signal.
