## How Internet Comes to our home ?

    1. Content Origin – Data Centers
        The internet starts at data centers, where websites, videos, and apps are hosted.
        These are massive server farms that store and manage digital content.

    2. Transmission Over Long Distances – Submarine Cables or Satellites
        Data is sent from data centers through:
            Submarine fiber optic cables under oceans (used for 99% of international traffic).
            Satellites, used in remote areas or for backup.

    3. Internet Backbone – Tier 1 ISPs
        The cables connect to Tier 1 ISPs like Tata, AT&T, or NTT that run the core global network.
        They own high-capacity cables and exchange data across continents.

    4. Regional Distribution – Tier 2 or Tier 3 ISPs
        Tier 2 and 3 ISPs buy access from Tier 1 providers.
        They manage regional internet traffic and connect cities, towns, and rural areas.

    5. Local Distribution – ISP Infrastructure in Your Area
        These ISPs run underground fiber optic, coaxial, or DSL lines to your neighborhood.
        This is often called the “last mile” connection.

    6. Home Connection – Modem & Router
        A wire enters your home and connects to a modem (converts signal into internet).
        The modem is connected to a router which creates a Wi-Fi network.

    7. Device Access – Internet on Your Devices
        Your devices (phones, laptops, TVs) connect to the router.
        Router assigns an IP address to your device.
        When you open a website or use an app, your request goes back through the entire path, and the data is returned
