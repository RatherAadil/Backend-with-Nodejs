## TCP/IP model

    The TCP/IP model is a 4-layer networking framework used by the Internet. It is more practical than
    the OSI model and reflects how data actually moves through a network.

    TCP/IP Layer	    Corresponding OSI Layers
    4. Application	    OSI Layer 7 (Application), 6 (Presentation), 5 (Session)
    3. Transport	    OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
    2. Internet	        OSI Layer 3 (Network)
    1. Network Access	OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) + Layer 1 (Physical)

### TCP/IP Layers in Detail

    Layer	            Function
    4. Application	     Provides services for user applications
    3. Transport	     Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control
    2. Internet	Handles  addressing and routing of packets across networks
    1. Network Access	 Deals with physical transmission and access to the media (hardware-level)

### Notes:

- The TCP/IP model is what the Internet is based on.
- It's simpler and more practical than the OSI model.
- OSI is often used for theoretical understanding, TCP/IP for real-world networking.
