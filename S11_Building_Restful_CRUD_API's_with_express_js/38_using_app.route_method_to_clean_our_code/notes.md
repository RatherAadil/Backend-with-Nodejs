## app.route() Method

- Used to chain multiple HTTP methods (like GET, POST, etc.) for the same route in a cleaner way.

Example:

```javascript
app.route('/user').get(getUser).post(createUser).put(updateUser);
```

- Keeps your code organized and readable.
- Functionally same as using app.get(), app.post() separately.
- Use it when methods share the same path.
