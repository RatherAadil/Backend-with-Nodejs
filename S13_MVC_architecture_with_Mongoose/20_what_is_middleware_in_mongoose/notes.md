# Mongoose Middleware (Hooks)

Mongoose middlewares (hooks) are functions that run before (pre) or after (post) certain operations like saving, querying, inserting, or aggregating.

## Types of Middleware

    * Document Middleware (save, validate, remove)
        Used to modify document data (e.g., hash passwords).

    * Query Middleware (find, findOne, etc.)
        Modify or log queries (e.g., exclude inactive users).

    * Model Middleware (insertMany)
        Modify documents before/after bulk insert.

    * Aggregate Middleware (aggregate)
        Edit aggregation pipeline (e.g., exclude deleted docs).
