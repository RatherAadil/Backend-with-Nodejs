# SCAN Command in Redis

The `SCAN` command in Redis is used to **incrementally iterate** over a collection of keys in the database without blocking (asynchronously) the server.

## Using SCAN in Redis CLI

```bash
SCAN <cursor> [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]
```

- **Default MATCH**: `*` (matches all keys)
- **Default COUNT**: `10` (approximate number of keys per batch)

### Example

```bash
SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 10
```

### Explanation

- `0` – initial cursor
- `MATCH user:*` – filter keys starting with `user:`
- `COUNT 10` – request up to 10 keys per batch (not guaranteed)

### Full Scan Loop (Manual)

Repeat the command using the cursor returned by the previous call until the cursor returned is `0`:

```bash
SCAN 0
SCAN 25
SCAN 97
... until cursor is 0
```

## Using SCAN in Node.js (Official `redis` Module)

```js
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient();
await client.connect();
```

### SCAN with Loop

```js
let cursor = 0;
do {
  const { cursor: nextCursor, keys } = await client.scan(cursor, {
    MATCH: '*',
    COUNT: 10,
  });

  console.log('Found keys:', keys);
  cursor = nextCursor;
} while (cursor !== 0);
```

### Output

Logs all keys in batches of up to 10 until the scan is complete.

## Notes

- `SCAN` is **non-blocking** and safe for large datasets.
- Always combine with `MATCH` to avoid scanning the entire keyspace unnecessarily.
- The `COUNT` is a **hint**, not a strict limit.
- If `MATCH` and `COUNT` are not provided, Redis uses:
  - `MATCH *` as the default pattern
  - `COUNT 10` as the default batch size

## ✅ Use Cases

- Cleaning up old or expired keys.
- Migrating or exporting subsets of data.
- Analyzing or monitoring key patterns.
