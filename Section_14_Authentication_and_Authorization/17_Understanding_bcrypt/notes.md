# Bcrypt

## Two NPM Packages:

    bcrypt → C++ based (faster, use in Node.js backend).
    bcryptjs → Pure JavaScript (use in browser or where native modules are not available).

# When to Use What:

    Node.js (server-side): Prefer bcrypt for performance.
    Browser (client-side): Use bcryptjs since it runs without native bindings.

## Common bcrypt Methods

1. **bcrypt.genSalt(rounds)**
   - Generates a unique salt.
   - rounds defines the cost factor — higher means slower but more secure.
   - Example:

   ```js
   const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
   ```

2. **bcrypt.hash(password, saltOrRounds)**
   - Hashes the password with a salt.
   - You can pass:
     - a salt string: bcrypt.hash(password, salt)
     - or rounds directly: bcrypt.hash(password, 10) (auto-generates salt)
   - Example:

```js
const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('mypassword', salt);
```

3. **bcrypt.compare(plain, hashed)**
   - Compares a plain password with its hashed version.
   - Returns true if matched.
   - Example:

```js
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare('mypassword', hashed);
```
