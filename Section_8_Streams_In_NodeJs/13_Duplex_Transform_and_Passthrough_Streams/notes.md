## Duplex, Transform, Pass Through Streams

`1.  Duplex Stream`

- It can read and write data — both at the same time.
- Think of it like a walkie-talkie — you can send and receive messages.

`2. Transform Stream`

- It can read and write, but it also changes (transforms) the data in between.
- Think of it like a translator — you say something, it converts it, and then passes it on.

`3. PassThrough Stream`

- It also reads and writes, but it does not change the data.
- Think of it like a glass pipe — data just passes through it.

### usage

```javascript
import { Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform, PassThrough } from 'streams';
```
