## Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

- Event-Driven Architecture is a design pattern used in software development where the flow of the program is determined by events.
- NodeJS handles I/O operations using EDA, making it efficient for asynchronous, non-blocking tasks like file reads, network requests, etc.

### Core Components of EDA:

- `Event Emitter`: The source that generates or emits events.
- `Event Listener`: A function that listens for specific events and triggers an action when the event occurs.
- `Event Handler`: The actual logic/function that runs in response to the event.

### Real-Life Examples of EDA:

- NodeJS internal architecture
- DOM events in browsers
- Chat applications (e.g., message received)
- Operating Systems handling keyboard/mouse input
- YouTube notifications
- Payment systems (e.g., success/failure callbacks)

### Code Example :

```javascript
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
h1.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('h1 clicked');
});
```

- `Explanation:`
  - h1 → Event Emitter
  - addEventListener() → Event Listener
  - The callback function → Event Handler
