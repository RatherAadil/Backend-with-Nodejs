## 1️⃣ Core Rule (Most Important)

In **Node.js**, **only module.exports is actually returned by require()**.

exports is **just a reference (shortcut)** to module.exports.

```javascript
console.log(module.exports === exports); // true
```

At the beginning, **both point to the same object**.

## 2️⃣ Understanding with Your address Example

```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Aman Mishra',
  age: 88,
  address: { city: 'Mumbai', state: 'Maharashtra' },
  hobbies: ['Sleeping', 'Coding', 'Eating'],
};
let address = user.address;
```

### Why is this true?

```javascript
console.log(user.address === address); // true
```

Because:

- address does **not create a copy**
- It stores a **reference to the same object in memory**

📌 **Both variables point to the same address object**

## 3️⃣ Modifying the Object (Reference Behavior)

```javascript
address.pincode = 40111;
address.country = 'India';
```

Now:

```javascript
`   console.log(user.address);
```

✔ user.address **also changes**

Why?

> Because both address and user.address point to the **same object**

## 4️⃣ Reassigning the Variable (Reference Breaks)

```javascript
address = { pincode: 5680, country: 'USA' };
console.log(address);
console.log(user.address);
```

### Output Conceptually:

- address → new object
- user.address → old object (unchanged)

💡 **Reassignment creates a NEW object**💡 **Original reference is NOT affected**

## 5️⃣ Same Concept Applies to exports

Internally, Node.js does something like this:

```javascript
let exports = module.exports;
```

So initially:

```javascript module.exports === exports // true

```

## 6️⃣ This Works ✅ (Mutating the Object)

```javascript
const product = { name: 'Laptop', price: 50000 };
let send = module.exports;
send.product = product;
```

Why does this work?

- You are **modifying the same object**
- module.exports still points to it

## 7️⃣ Where the Problem Comes ❌ (Reassignment)

❌ **THIS IS WRONG**

```javascript
exports = { sum, products };
```

### Why this breaks?

Because:

- You are **reassigning exports**
- module.exports is still pointing to {}

📌 Now:

```javascript
exports !== module.exports;
```

📌 require() only reads **module.exports**📌 So it gets an **empty object {}**

## 8️⃣ Correct Ways to Export

### ✅ Best & Safest (Recommended)

```javascript
module.exports = { sum, products };
```

### ✅ Also Safe (Property-wise)

```javascript
exports.sum = sum;
exports.products = products;
```

### ❌ Never Do This

```javascript
exports = { sum, products }; // ❌ breaks reference
```

## 9️⃣ One-Line Summary (Exam / Interview Ready)

> exports is just a reference to module.exports.Mutating works, reassignment breaks.require() only returns module.exports.
